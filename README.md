## Getting Started

To run these scripts, you need Python 3 and the `json` module, which comes pre-installed with Python.

## File Descriptions

### json-module-usages.py

This script demonstrates how to use the `json` module to store and load data. It creates a list of cubes of odd numbers from 1 to 10, stores it in a JSON file, then loads the data from the file and prints it.

### greet_user_application.py

This script demonstrates how to use the `json` module to create a simple user greeting application. It prompts the user to enter their username, stores it in a JSON file, then greets the user by their username. If the username is already stored in the file, it will ask the user to confirm.
